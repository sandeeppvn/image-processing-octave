# image-processing-octave
This is a basic code written in octave that compares a given image using the basic concept of linear algebra and tells you if the given image is an Apple or a Bannana.  

You will need to download OCTAVE - an open source version of MATLAB to run this code Link: http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html    

1.Download all the files into one folder      

2.Open supervised_learning.m      

3.Change the path names of the images and results if needed    

4.Build and run the octave code.    

5.You have obtained your images in the initial folder.
